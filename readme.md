### PureO2 Oxygen Monitoring for patients with masks


The creation of a monitoring system for patients wearing an oxygen mask, there are various logistical challenges when ensuring that the patient wearing the mask is receiving a constant supply of oxygen whilst they are sleeping, since during the night when the patient would be sleeping the wearer may potentially dislodge the mask or the connection to the oxygen supply may also be disconnected.

The software running with the system is intended to monitor the status of the oxygen mask this will then sound an alarm, should the system detect that the patient may not be receiving a sufficient supply of oxygen. In addition to this, the system will also display information within a web page or application to allow a recorded log of information to be created and the data to be viewed visually to see whether the patient is potentially receiving a sufficient supply of oxygen, or not which could be due to the mask being at an incorrect orientation or the pipe being disconnected from the connector valve.
